## mx-chain-es-indexer-go


Is a versatile component designed to enhance the data management capabilities of the mx-chain-go repository. 
This module can be seamlessly integrated as a Go module or deployed as a separate microservice that communicates with [mx-chain-go](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-chain-go)
over a `WebSocket` connection. 
Its core functionality revolves around the efficient interaction with an `Elasticsearch` database.

### Overview

Modern applications require sophisticated data handling mechanisms to ensure optimal performance, data integrity, and real-time accessibility.
`mx-chain-es-indexer-go` addresses these requirements by facilitating data transformation, indexing, and storage within an Elasticsearch database. 
This module's flexibility enables it to be used in two distinct modes: as a Go module or as a separate microservice.

### Features
- **Data Transformation**: `mx-chain-es-indexer-go` excels at transforming raw data generated by the `mx-chain-go` repository into a structured format suitable for indexing and storage.

- **Indexing**: The module efficiently indexes the transformed data within Elasticsearch, enhancing query performance and data retrieval.

- **Microservice Mode**: In microservice mode, mx-chain-es-indexer-go operates as a standalone microservice that communicates with mx-chain-go via WebSocket connections. This architecture promotes modularity and scalability.

- **Go Module Mode**: In Go module mode, the module can be directly integrated into the mx-chain-go repository, offering seamless data management capabilities without the need for a separate microservice.
